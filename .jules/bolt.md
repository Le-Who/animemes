## 2024-05-22 - [Perceived Performance: Image Preloading]
**Learning:** In a simple SPA game relying on external images, the biggest performance bottleneck is network latency. Preloading the next asset significantly improves perceived speed.
**Action:** Always look for opportunities to preload assets in user flows where the next step is predictable.

**Learning:** Aggressive cache-busting (e.g., timestamp query params) on static data files forces unnecessary redownloads on every page load, hurting repeat visit performance.
**Action:** Relies on standard HTTP caching (ETag/Last-Modified) for static assets unless instant updates are critical for development.
