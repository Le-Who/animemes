# PALETTE'S JOURNAL

This journal tracks critical UX and accessibility learnings from the project.

## 2026-02-01 - Keyboard Shortcut Discoverability
**Learning:** Users may not realize keyboard shortcuts exist without visual cues. Adding persistent visual hints (like keycaps) reinforces accessibility and power-user features simultaneously.
**Action:** Always pair keyboard listeners with visual indicators or tooltips.

## 2026-02-02 - Status Icon Feedback
**Learning:** Relying solely on color (green/red overlays) for game state feedback excludes colorblind users. Adding redundant shape-based indicators (icons) provides a more robust and delightful experience.
**Action:** Ensure all color-coded states are accompanied by a distinct icon or text label.
