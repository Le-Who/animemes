## 2025-02-18 - CSS Injection via Unsanitized CSS Variables
**Vulnerability:** `index.html` injected external API data directly into a CSS variable (`--bg-image`) used in a `url()` function. This allowed potential CSS injection if the data contained single quotes or parentheses.
**Learning:** Even CSS variables can be injection vectors when used in functional contexts like `url()`, `attr()`, or `calc()`. Trusting external data (API) for style properties requires the same sanitization rigor as DOM injection.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize data before assigning it to CSS variables, especially if they are destined for functional CSS notation. Use specific sanitization that escapes context-breaking characters (quotes, parens) and encodes the URI.
