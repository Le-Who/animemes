## 2025-02-18 - CSS Injection via Unsanitized CSS Variables
**Vulnerability:** `index.html` injected external API data directly into a CSS variable (`--bg-image`) used in a `url()` function. This allowed potential CSS injection if the data contained single quotes or parentheses.
**Learning:** Even CSS variables can be injection vectors when used in functional contexts like `url()`, `attr()`, or `calc()`. Trusting external data (API) for style properties requires the same sanitization rigor as DOM injection.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize data before assigning it to CSS variables, especially if they are destined for functional CSS notation. Use specific sanitization that escapes context-breaking characters (quotes, parens) and encodes the URI.
## 2026-02-02 - CSS Injection in CSS Variables
**Vulnerability:** Unsanitized URLs used in `style.setProperty('--bg-image', ...)` allowed potential CSS injection via quote breaking.
**Learning:** CSP does not prevent CSS injection within `style` attributes if the attribute itself is trusted but the content is malicious.
**Prevention:** Implement strict input validation and escaping for any string interpolated into CSS values, especially `url()`.
## 2026-10-27 - Shadowed Security Functions
**Vulnerability:** `index.html` contained multiple definitions of critical sanitizer functions (`safeUrl`, `safeCSSUrl`), where later definitions silently overwrote earlier ones. This created ambiguity about which security policy was active (blacklist vs whitelist) and led to double-sanitization bugs.
**Learning:** In single-file applications without modules, hoisting and global scope pollution make it easy to accidentally shadow functions.
**Prevention:** Centralize all security functions at the top of the script. Adopt a "sanitize at sink" pattern: helper functions should return raw data, and sanitizers should be applied only at the point of DOM insertion to avoid double-encoding issues.
## 2025-02-18 - Parameter Injection via String Formatting
**Vulnerability:** `update.py` constructed API URLs using string formatting (e.g., `f"{API_URL}&tags={tag}"`), allowing user-controlled tag inputs from JSON to inject arbitrary query parameters (like `&limit=1`) into the backend request.
**Learning:** String interpolation for URL construction is an SSRF-related risk that fails to safely URL-encode query parameters.
**Prevention:** Always use the `params` dictionary argument provided by HTTP libraries like `requests` to automatically apply secure, context-aware URL encoding to all query inputs.
